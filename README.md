An electron app created to be an easier and more organized way to store crypto transactions.

The software is (as of 17.01.2024) still work in progress. Mostly missing the overview and market tabs.
Crypto transaction information can be entered, edited and removed by using the UI, which then creates/modifies a local database on the machine and stores all of the information in it.
Database files can be changed from the "Database tab", where you can pick a .db file from your local machine. New coins can be added and existing ones removed and edited.
